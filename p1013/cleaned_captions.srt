184
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:57,933
What's going on?

198
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,163
Where did he get another phone?

225
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,401
Oh!

227
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,130
What was that?

253
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,405
Where is he, people?

263
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,823
Where is he?

269
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,845
Oh!
He's reaching for something.

270
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,009
Oh!  He's got a gun.
Stay on the line.

449
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,165
The safe is empty.  Man!

454
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,633
Get a backup team in there!

487
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,611
What are you doing? I'm trying
to send him a message.

518
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,115
What is this?

520
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,398
What just happened?

530
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,620
Come on, Pam, we're in
the middle of an operation.

650
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:18,410
She's in league with Jason Bourne!

747
01:16:51,457 --> 01:16:52,924
It's a risk.

846
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,705
He's got everything.

850
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:05,113
Every room, every hallway,
every closet, every air duct.

858
01:25:22,067 --> 01:25:25,093
Four-fifteen-seventy-one?  Pam!

876
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:26,017
It's a code!

901
01:31:59,398 --> 01:32:01,730
Just get out of there.

929
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:41,051
Move! South bay! Go!
